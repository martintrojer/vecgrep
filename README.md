# vecgrep

Semantic grep — like [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), but with vector search.

vecgrep uses a local embedding model ([all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)) to search your codebase by meaning rather than exact text matches. The model is embedded directly in the binary — no external services, no API keys, fully offline.

## Usage

```bash
# Search for a concept
vecgrep "error handling for network timeouts" ./src

# Search with more results and a lower threshold
vecgrep "database connection pooling" ./src -k 20 -t 0.2

# Filter by file type
vecgrep "sorting algorithm" --type rust

# Interactive TUI mode
vecgrep -i "authentication"

# JSON output for scripting
vecgrep "retry logic" --json | jq '.score'

# HTTP server mode (load model once, query via curl)
# Omit --port to auto-pick a free port; the URL is printed to stderr
vecgrep --serve --port 8080 ./src
# => Listening on http://127.0.0.1:8080
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/search?q=error+handling&k=5"

# Use with fzf for interactive fuzzy semantic search
vecgrep --serve --port 8080 ./src &
fzf --bind "change:reload:curl -s 'http://localhost:8080/search?q={q}'" --preview 'echo {}'

# Index management
vecgrep --stats              # show index statistics
vecgrep --reindex ./src      # force full re-index
vecgrep --clear-cache        # delete cached index
vecgrep --index-only ./src   # build index without searching
```

## How it works

1. **Walk** — discovers files on a background thread using the same engine as ripgrep (`.gitignore`-aware, binary detection), streaming them through a bounded channel
2. **Chunk** — splits files into overlapping token-window chunks, snapped to line boundaries
3. **Embed** — runs each chunk through the ONNX model to produce a 384-dimensional vector
4. **Index** — caches embeddings in a local SQLite database (`.vecgrep/index.db`), keyed by BLAKE3 content hash so only changed files are re-embedded on subsequent runs
5. **Search** — computes cosine similarity between your query embedding and all cached chunk embeddings, returns top-k results

Walking and indexing overlap — the embedder processes files as the walker discovers them. In interactive (`-i`) and server (`--serve`) modes, results appear progressively as files are indexed.

## Why local-only?

vecgrep runs entirely on your machine. There are no API calls, no cloud services, no telemetry. Your code never leaves your computer.

This matters for:

- **Privacy** — proprietary codebases stay private
- **Speed** — no network round-trips; search is a local matrix multiply that takes <5ms
- **Availability** — works offline, on planes, behind firewalls, in air-gapped environments
- **Cost** — no API fees, no usage limits

## Model choice

vecgrep embeds [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) directly in the binary. This is a 22M-parameter sentence transformer that produces 384-dimensional embeddings.

Why this model:

- **Small and fast** — 90 MB (float32 ONNX), runs inference in single-digit milliseconds on CPU. No GPU required.
- **Good quality for its size** — consistently ranks near the top of [MTEB](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) benchmarks among models under 100 MB. Handles both natural language and code well.
- **Standard BERT architecture** — wide ONNX Runtime support across platforms (x86, ARM, with optional CoreML/CUDA acceleration).
- **Battle-tested** — one of the most downloaded sentence-transformers models, with well-understood behaviour.

The model is downloaded once at build time from HuggingFace, cached locally, and compiled into the binary via `include_bytes!`. The resulting binary is fully self-contained.

## Install

Pre-built binaries for macOS and Linux are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/mtrojer/vecgrep/releases). Download the appropriate archive, extract it, and place the `vecgrep` binary on your `PATH`.

To build from source:

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

The first build downloads the ONNX model (~90 MB) from HuggingFace and caches it locally. Subsequent builds reuse the cached model.
