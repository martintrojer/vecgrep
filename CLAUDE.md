# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build & Run

```bash
cargo build                    # debug build (downloads ~90MB ONNX model on first build)
cargo build --release          # release build (LTO enabled, ~109MB binary)
cargo test                     # run all tests (requires model, so first build must complete)
cargo test embedder::tests::test_embed_single  # run a single test
```

The first build downloads `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model files from HuggingFace and caches them at `$VECGREP_MODEL_CACHE` or the system cache dir (`~/Library/Caches/vecgrep/models/` on macOS). Subsequent builds skip the download.

Debug logging: `VECGREP_LOG=debug cargo run -- "query" ./path`

**Benchmarking models**: When swapping models in `build.rs` for benchmarking, you must clear both caches to avoid stale model files. The download cache uses filename-based keys (`model.onnx`) so different model URLs collide:
```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/vecgrep/models/
cargo clean
cargo test --test benchmark_models -- --nocapture
```

**GPU/ANE acceleration**: We tested CoreML execution provider (Apple Neural Engine) via `ort`'s `coreml` feature flag. Findings:
- CoreML is **significantly slower** than CPU on real workloads (tested on a Markdown vault)
- CoreML session compilation adds ~1s overhead per session creation
- For our small model (22M params), CPU inference is already <5ms per query
- Tests ran ~8× slower with CoreML due to session compilation overhead
- The data transfer overhead between CPU↔ANE exceeds any compute savings at this model size
- Conclusion: CPU-only is the right choice. Don't revisit unless the model grows significantly (>100M params)

## Before Committing

Always run these before committing:

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

## Architecture

vecgrep is a semantic grep tool: it embeds a query and file chunks into vectors using a local ONNX model, then ranks chunks by cosine similarity.

**Data pipeline** (orchestrated in `main.rs`, streamed via `std::sync::mpsc`):

```
walker (thread) →  channel(64)  →  StreamingIndexer  →  index (SQLite)  →  search  →  output/tui/serve
(files)            (backpressure)   (chunk + embed)      (cache)            (rank)     (display)
```

The walker runs on a background thread feeding files through a bounded `sync_channel(batch_size * 2)`. All three modes use `pipeline::StreamingIndexer` to consume the channel:

- **CLI default**: searches immediately against the cached index, then `drain_all()` indexes remaining files in the background for next time.
- **CLI `--full-index`**: `drain_all()` blocks until all files are indexed (with threshold prompt), then searches.
- **TUI/serve**: `poll()` drains non-blockingly (up to `STREAMING_BATCH_SIZE` per iteration), reloading the index every 2 seconds so results appear progressively.

**Key design decisions:**

- **Model embedded in binary**: `build.rs` downloads model + tokenizer at build time; they're compiled into the binary via `include_bytes!`. This means the ONNX model (~90MB) lives in `$OUT_DIR/models/` and the binary is self-contained.
- **ort API quirks**: `ort` v2.0.0-rc.12 errors are not `Send+Sync`, so `?` with `anyhow` doesn't work — all ort calls must use `.map_err(|e| anyhow::anyhow!("{}", e))`. `Session::run` requires `&mut self`.
- **Embeddings are L2-normalized**, so cosine similarity = dot product. The search module (`search.rs`) exploits this by doing a simple `embedding_matrix.dot(&query)`.
- **Cache invalidation**: BLAKE3 content hash per file. If model name or chunk params change (stored in `meta` table as JSON), the entire index is rebuilt.
- **Index location**: `.vecgrep/index.db` in the project root directory. Automatically added to `.gitignore`. The project root is discovered by walking up from the search path looking for `.git/`, `.hg/`, `.jj/`, or `.vecgrep/`. Use `--show-root` to print it.
- **JSON output includes `root`**: All JSONL output (`--json` and `--serve`) includes a `"root"` field with the canonical project root path, so clients can resolve the project-root-relative `"file"` paths.
- **Embeddings stored as BLOB**: `Vec<f32>` → little-endian bytes in SQLite, reconstituted into `ndarray::Array2<f32>` for search.
- **CLI flags follow ripgrep conventions**: `-t` for type, `-g` for glob, `-C` for context, `-l` for files-with-matches, `-c` for count, `-.` for hidden, `-L` for follow, etc. Any new CLI flag must be checked against `rg --help` for compatibility — do not reuse a short flag that means something different in rg.

**Module responsibilities:**

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| `embedder.rs` | ONNX session + tokenizer, batch inference with mean-pooling |
| `chunker.rs` | Split file content into overlapping token-window chunks, snapped to line boundaries |
| `pipeline.rs` | `StreamingIndexer` (channel consumer with `poll()`/`drain_all()`), `process_batch()` for chunk → embed → upsert |
| `paths.rs` | Path conversions: `to_project_relative()`, `to_cwd_relative()` |
| `index.rs` | SQLite schema (`meta`/`files`/`chunks`), upsert, stale removal, bulk load into ndarray |
| `search.rs` | Matrix dot-product scoring, top-k partial sort, threshold filter |
| `walker.rs` | `ignore` crate for .gitignore-aware file discovery; `walk_with()` helper, `walk_paths_streaming()` for channel-based walking |
| `output.rs` | `termcolor` for ripgrep-style colored output, JSONL mode, TTY detection |
| `serve.rs` | `tiny_http` server for `--serve` mode; `run_streaming()` interleaves indexing with request handling |
| `tui.rs` | `ratatui` interactive mode; `run_streaming()` interleaves indexing with the event loop |
